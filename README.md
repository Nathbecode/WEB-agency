# A+ Studio Web Design Project

## Overview
This project is a **static web page** designed to showcase front-end web design and styling capabilities. It emphasizes **CSS**, **HTML**, and basic **JavaScript** for interactive elements, without backend functionality. The primary goal is to demonstrate modern design practices.

## Features
- **Responsive Navigation Bar:** Fixed navbar with logo and section links (Home, Services, Blog, etc.).
- **Hero Section:** Includes a tagline and a call-to-action button that opens a contact modal.
- **Modal Contact Form:** Features email and message fields with basic validation.
- **Client Section:** Displays logos of notable clients (e.g., Google, Amazon).
- **Services Section:** Describes the agency's offerings with scroll animations (AOS).
- **Testimonial Carousel:** Swiper.js-powered carousel featuring client feedback.
- **Newsletter Subscription:** Allows users to subscribe via email, triggering a modal.
- **Footer Section:** Provides additional navigation and agency information.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML & CSS:** Structure and styling, with a separate `style.css` file.
- **JavaScript:** Manages modals, form validation, and prevents form submission.
- **External Libraries:** AOS for animations and Swiper.js for the testimonial slider.

## Limitations
- **Static Content:** No backend or dynamic data handling.
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates styling capabilities; not intended for deployment as a fully functional site.
